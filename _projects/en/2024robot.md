Lead designer for the drivetrain and manipulator subsystems on the 2025 FRC Team 199 competition robot.

### Design Contributions
* **Swerve Drivetrain:** Designed a custom holonomic chassis layout to integrate commercial swerve modules. The frame was optimized for rigidity and low center of gravity while packaging all electronics and battery management systems within the bumper perimeter.
* **Manipulator Arm:** Engineered a **double-jointed arm mechanism** driven by high-torque chain and sprocket transmission. The system utilizes heavy-duty box tubing and custom gussets to handle the dynamic loads of intake and scoring operations.
* **Integration:** Coordinated the master assembly in CAD (SolidWorks/Onshape), ensuring clearance for the intake rollers and climber mechanisms within the robot's starting configuration frame.

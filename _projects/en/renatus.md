April - August 2025
Designed key mechanical subsystems for an autonomous warehouse logistics robot, focusing on vertical reach and package handling efficiency.

### Engineering Contributions
* **Telescoping Elevator:** Designed a **cascading elevator fork system** to maximize vertical reach while maintaining a compact collapsed footprint. The multi-stage design allows the robot to access high storage racks within a limited chassis envelope.
* **Actuation System:** Engineered a **chain and pulley actuation system** to drive the telescoping motion. This robust transmission ensures synchronized lifting of the fork stages under heavy loads.
* **End-Effector:** Developed a servo-actuated **grabbing mechanism** integrated into the fork carriage. The system utilizes precise timing belt drives to engage and retrieve standard warehouse bins.

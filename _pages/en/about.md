I am a first-year at the **University of California, Berkeley**, majoring in **Mechanical Engineering** with a minor in **Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS)**. I am currently an undergraduate researcher at the [Mechanical Systems Controls (MSC) Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/) and Vehicle Dynamics Engineer at [Formula Electric at Berkeley](https://ev.studentorg.berkeley.edu/).

I am also a **Masason Foundation Scholar** (8th Generation), a community of youth supported by the foundation established by Masayoshi Son, receiving **full funding for my education and grants for research projects**. 

I am passionate about engineering solutions in robotics.
